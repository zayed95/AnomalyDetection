# A/B testing with Logistic Regression
Anomaly Detection with Logistic Regression — Controlled Preprocessing Experiments using MLflow.

---

## Overviwe
This project explores the impact of different preprocessing pipelines on a logistic regression–based anomaly detection system. Using controlled experiments tracked with MLflow, multiple preprocessing strategies are compared under fixed model hyperparameters. The best-performing pipeline is then fine-tuned and promoted through the MLflow Model Registry.

### Phase 1
* Same model
* Same hyperparameters
* Same training and validation sets
* Only the processing pipeline differ

### Phase 2
* Selected best perfoming model
* Performed fine tuning to optimize anomaly recall
* Final pipeline logged and registered

### Evaluation Strategy
* Recall was prioritized to minimize missed anomalies

### ML Pipeline Design
* Implemented leak-free sklearn / imblearn Pipelines
* Preprocessing and model steps are versioned together
* Ensures reproducibility across experiments

### Experiment Tracking with MLflow
MLflow was used to:

* Track parameters and metrics
* Log full preprocessing + model pipelines
* Compare preprocessing strategies
* Register the final model

## How to run

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```mlflow ui```
